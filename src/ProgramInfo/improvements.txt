DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS FROM PHASE 1:
- Used more abstract implementations of certain types, for example instantiation using List<T> instead of ArrayList<T>.
- Gateway classes were combined to 2 main gateways (one for reading in data [ConferenceDataSaver], the other for saving
  data to Data folder [ConferenceDataReceiver]).
- There is now zero dependence between classes of the same layer in Use Case and Entity layers - this provides greater
  encapsulation and more decoupling.
- The inheritance model with User object has been improved.
- The long method in the ProgramController class has been divided up into several controller classes, each detailing a
  specific system in the program (MessageSystem and ScheduleSystem).
